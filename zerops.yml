      - npm run build

    # select which files / folders to deploy
    # after the build succesfully finished
    # `~` can be used to mark starting point
    # of deploy path, this example would deploy
    # files in folder dist without the folder
    # itself, either way make sure your nginx
    # config points to the correct folder
    deploy: [ 'dist/~' ]

    # *optional*: which files / folders
    # to cache for the next use
    cache: [ node_modules ]

  # ==== how to run your application ====
  # (usually no changes needed for a static server)
  #run:
    # *optional* install dependencies that your
    # runtime service requires (will be cached)
    # prepare:
    #   - apt-get something
    #   - curl otherthing

    # *optional*: triggered before each start/restart
    # of your application, to eg. clean cache
    # init:
    #  - rm -rf ./cache
